# analyse_diffraction
Several functions to analyse simple diffraction data. Contains a function to predict diffraction peaks of simple structures (up to primitive tetragonal)

analyse_diffraction.ipynb contains a functionality for warning when ions are of similar size, but this requires a package called Mendeley which can be tricky to install.
Therefore, analyse_diffraction_without_Mendeley.ipynb can be used instead if the functionality is not required.

SigFigRounding.py is a required file, used to correctly round all the indexed data.
